          <Title order={3}>Binding Arbitration</Title>
          <Text>
            If informal negotiations fail to resolve any disputes between you and us (except for
            disputes expressly excluded below), such disputes will be resolved exclusively through
            binding arbitration. By agreeing to arbitration, you waive your right to file a lawsuit
            in court or have a jury trial. Arbitration will follow the Commercial Arbitration Rules
            of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) and, where applicable, the AAA&apos;s
            Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (AAA Consumer Rules). These rules
            can be found on the AAA&apos;s website.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Arbitration fees and arbitrator compensation will be governed by, and where applicable,
            limited by, the AAA Consumer Rules. The arbitration may occur in person, via document
            submission, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will issue a written decision, but is
            not required to provide an explanation unless requested by either party. The arbitrator
            must apply applicable law, and any arbitration award can be contested if the arbitrator
            fails to do so.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Unless otherwise required by the AAA rules or applicable law, arbitration will take
            place in Sheridan County, Wyoming. Either party may, however, seek to enforce
            arbitration, stay court proceedings, or challenge an arbitration award in court as
            permitted under law.
          </Text>

          <Title order={3}>Court Proceedings</Title>
          <Text>
            If, for any reason, a dispute proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, it must
            be filed in the state or federal courts located in Sheridan County, Wyoming. Both
            parties consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of these courts and waive any defense
            related to lack of personal jurisdiction or inconvenient forum. The United Nations
            Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) and the Uniform
            Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are expressly excluded from these Legal
            Terms.

            All claims and disputes related to the Services must be initiated within one (1) year
            after the cause of action arises. If this time limit is not met, the claim is
            permanently barred. If any part of this provision is found to be illegal or
            unenforceable, that portion will be handled by a court with proper jurisdiction, and the
            remaining parts of this provision will remain in effect.

          <Title order={3}>Restrictions</Title>
          <Text>
            Arbitration will be limited to disputes between you and us individually. To the fullest
            extent permitted by law:
          </Text>
          <ul>
            <li>No arbitration will be combined with any other proceedings;</li>
            <li>
              Disputes cannot be arbitrated on a class-action basis or as part of a class-action
              proceeding;
            </li>
            <li>
              Disputes cannot be brought in a representative capacity on behalf of the public or
              other individuals.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <Title order={3}>Exceptions to Arbitration</Title>
          <Text>
            The following disputes are excluded from binding arbitration and may be brought in
            court:
          </Text>
          <ul>
            <li>Disputes seeking to enforce or protect intellectual property rights;</li>
            <li>Disputes related to theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use;</li>
            <li>Claims for injunctive relief.</li>
          </ul>
          <Text>
            If any part of this arbitration provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the
            remaining portions will still apply, and disputes not subject to arbitration will be
            resolved in the courts specified above, with both parties agreeing to submit to that
            {"court's"} jurisdiction.

            These Legal Terms, along with any policies or operating rules posted by us on the
            Services or in relation to the Services, constitute the entire agreement and
            understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or
            provision of these Legal Terms shall not be considered a waiver of that right or
            provision. These Legal Terms will be enforced to the fullest extent permitted by law.

            We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others at any time without
            prior notice to you. We will not be liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to
            act due to causes beyond our reasonable control.

            If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is found to be unlawful,
            void, or unenforceable, that provision or part shall be deemed severable from these
            Legal Terms and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining
            provisions.

            and us as a result of these Legal Terms or your use of the Services. You agree that
            these Legal Terms will not be construed against us merely because we drafted them.
